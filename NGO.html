            <small>
                   Help In Suffering (HIS) is a registered Indian charitable trust working for the benefit of the animals in India. We are associated with Help In Suffering U.K., Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations , Animaux- Secure France , Les Amis Suisses du Refuge de l’Espoir Switzerland and Working for Animals Australia HIS was founded in 1980 by a British animal lover,Miss Crystal Rodgers, aiming for helping suffering animals and all living things. The veterinary hospital was started with limited resources, in a small areawhich was later extended to 2 acres of wooded land in south Jaipur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Help in Suffering provides free, quality, emergency medical and surgical care for domesticated and street animals, regardless of age,who are ill or victims of traumatic injuries and who have been abused, starved and/or abandoned by their owners. HIS is run by a team of extremely dedicated and staff and their compassion for animals is what drives them to strive harder. We have thirty-five trained staffmembers for handling the sick and traumatisedanimals, five rescue ambulances and two mobile clinic vehicles. Animal welfare projects are conducted underthe guidance of trained Vets. The campus providespeaceful surroundings and a serene, green natural habitat for animals to support quick healing. HIS also has adequate administrative procedures in place to ensure documentation, accounting and overall management. It has been almost four decades and we are stillproviding shelter, medical aid and care to birds and animals of all species. This would not have been possible without the support and encouragement of our donors. Indeed, in the absence of any governmental funding or support, it is only due to the generosity of our donors from all across the globe, that HIS has been able to sustain itself. Over the years, we have grown into a large animal welfare organization with a number of projects. We can proudly claim that due to ourvigorous efforts, Jaipur has become the only city in Rajasthan which is Rabies free. Our Animal Birth Control programme is another of our success stories, as result of which, dog bite cases in Jaipur, are very fewas compared to the other parts of the country. We also run a specialist Camel Rescue Centre in Bassi, in rural Jaipur district, to serve sick, old and injuredcamels. Our mobile camel rescue team is well known in the state for their tremendous work and dedication. Having achieved so much and in spite of having served for 4 decades, we are still constantly working towards improving the facilities that we are able to offer. Owing to the substantial cost of medical equipment we have been unable to upgrade our resources. We are desperately short of some life-saving and diagnostic tools which are commonplace in all hospitals but are not available for animals. However, we forge ahead,undaunted to provide the best we can under the circumstances.
